Here are some useful aliases:

```shell
alias beep='osascript -e '\''beep'\'

# aliases for sh config
alias catz='cat ~/.zshrc'
alias srcz='source ~/.zshrc'
```

Just register them in your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)

Some aliases are NOT in this list and are just exec. Some aliases have to be exec to treat arguments.
